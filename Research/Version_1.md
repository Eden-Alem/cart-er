# Abstract Idea and the MVP

Ideally, I'm looking forward to:
Design and implement an automated coupling mechanism on each cart that can connect and disconnect the carts without the need for the driver to get out of the car. This mechanism can be controlled electronically through a computer interface.

Let's start by setting the Minimumm Viable Product (MVP)
Given the fact that I don't have access to physical machinery or sensors, let's start off with the core of the product the "Automated Chaining and Unchaining Algorithms". Building a Machine Learning algorithm to start the development process of developing algorithms that can automatically determine the optimal time and conditions to chain and unchain the carts. 

The first step in this process is data collection. Since, I don't have access to real sensors that can generate data. We will be making use of dummy data for developing and testing the algorithms.

Some plausible types of data that could be provided by different sensors would be as follows:
- Position Data:
    - GPS Sensor: Provides the latitude, longitude, and altitude of each cart, allowing the system to track their positions.
    - Encoders: Measures the rotation of wheels or tracks, enabling the system to determine the distance traveled and the position of each cart.

- Alignment Data:
    - Infrared Sensors or Cameras: Detect the presence and alignment of coupling mechanisms on each cart, ensuring they are properly aligned for chaining or unchaining.

- Distance Data:
    - Ultrasonic Sensors or LIDAR: Measures the distance between adjacent carts, helping to ensure a safe and appropriate distance for chaining or unchaining.
    - Proximity Sensors: Detect the presence of nearby objects or obstacles during the process to avoid collisions.

- Velocity Data:
    - Wheel Speed Sensors: Measure the speed of the wheels or tracks, providing information about the velocity of each cart.

- Status and Safety Data:
    - Hall Effect Sensors or Magnetic Sensors: Detect the presence of magnetic tags or markers on the track, providing safety interlocks to prevent chaining in hazardous areas or when not permitted.
    - Emergency Stop Buttons: Allow the driver to initiate an emergency stop during the chaining or unchaining process if required.

-  Environmental Data:
    - Temperature and Humidity Sensors: Monitor environmental conditions, ensuring the system operates effectively in different weather conditions.
    - Light Sensors: Detect ambient lighting levels, which could influence certain operations.


And so we start by simulating or generating dummy data that closely resembles the data we expect to receive from the actual sensors. 

**Keep in Mind:** the real-world performance of the automated coupling mechanism will depend on the integration with the physical hardware and the accuracy of the actual sensor data. Moving forward, we need to make adjustments and improvements based on real-world testing with the hardware and sensors.

Next pursuit: Generating dummy data through several methods depending on the needs and preferences.
